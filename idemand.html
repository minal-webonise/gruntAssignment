                        <p><strong>The Right to Information Act is no doubt a progressive piece of legislation. But the political party that brought about
                            the legislation does not seem to be keen to bring its own affairs under the purview of RTI Act.</strong> Atleast that is the
                            message conveyed by Congress when it opposed tooth and nail the Central Information Commission’s ruling that six national
                            parties including BJP, NCP, CPI-M, CPI Bahujan Samaj Party, and the ruling party itself come under the RTI purview and
                            they should appoint PIOs to provide any information regarding the party’s functioning. Such is the commitment of our
                            political parties to democracy, transparency and accountability.</p>
                        <p>Infact most of our political parties run dictatorship under the garb of democracy. How they choose their presidents and
                            other members of the governing body? Why they choose them? Why a particular candidate is preferred over another? Why
                            party ticket was given to one and why it was denied to another? Such questions are never answered. In countries like
                            Great Britain political parties are very strong at the local level. The local party plays primal role in all the spheres
                            of political activity. In the US Political Parties are decentralized.  Their greatest organizational strength is at
                            the local and county level.</p>
                        <p>The situation is quite opposite to that in India. The powers of Political parties are highly centralized and they
                            give no scope to organizational democracy, transparency and accountability.</p>
                        <p>The flow of ideas is only one sided. The decisions come only from above. The aspirations of the grassroots level
                            local cadres are seldom taken into consideration.</p>

                        <span>Why?</span>
                        <p><strong>The Right to Information Act is no doubt a progressive piece of legislation. But the political party that brought about
                            the legislation does not seem to be keen to bring its own affairs under the purview of RTI Act.</strong> Atleast that is the
                            message conveyed by Congress when it opposed tooth and nail the Central Information Commission’s ruling that six national
                            parties including BJP, NCP, CPI-M, CPI Bahujan Samaj Party, and the ruling party itself come under the RTI purview and
                            they should appoint PIOs to provide any information regarding the party’s functioning. Such is the commitment of our
                            political parties to democracy, transparency and accountability.</p>
                        <p>Infact most of our political parties run dictatorship under the garb of democracy. How they choose their presidents and
                            other members of the governing body? Why they choose them? Why a particular candidate is preferred over another? Why
                            party ticket was given to one and why it was denied to another? Such questions are never answered. In countries like
                            Great Britain political parties are very strong at the local level. The local party plays primal role in all the spheres
                            of political activity. In the US Political Parties are decentralized.  Their greatest organizational strength is at
                            the local and county level.</p>
                        <p>The situation is quite opposite to that in India. The powers of Political parties are highly centralized and they
                            give no scope to organizational democracy, transparency and accountability.</p>
                        <p>The flow of ideas is only one sided. The decisions come only from above. The aspirations of the grassroots level
                            local cadres are seldom taken into consideration.</p>
